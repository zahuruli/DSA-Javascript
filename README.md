# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms in JavaScript

Welcome to my **DSA in JavaScript** journey! This repository contains my daily practice, implementations, and notes as I explore and master common data structures and algorithms using JavaScript. It's designed to help other learners follow along, understand the core concepts, and improve their coding skills.
